# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Native Hyperlink Support**: Implemented recursive hyperlink extraction for `<a>` tags. Maps `href` to PowerPoint URLs and `title` attributes to native tooltips.
- **Flexbox Axis-Swap Intelligence**: Added `flex-direction` aware alignment. Centering now works correctly for both `row` and `column` flex containers by dynamically swapping `align`/`valign` axes based on the main-axis orientation.
- **Expanded Text Tag Support**: Added `CENTER`, `P`, and `H1-H6` to the "safe text" whitelist, allowing these elements to render as single unified PowerPoint shapes rather than fragmented items.
- **Enhanced Agentic Skills (v2.0)**: Re-architected the `dom-to-pptx-skill` into an autonomous presentation engineering framework.
  - **Atmospheric UI Engine**: Codified premium design philosophies (Luminous Bias, Spatial Tension, Materiality) into the skill directives.
  - **Multi-Phase Workflow**: Added mandatory phases for Content Intelligence, Theme Engineering, and Pre-Export Validation.
  - **Local Image Strategy**: Implemented automated local image generation and management using the `images/` directory workflow.

### Fixed

- **Hyperlink Text Styling**: Fixed a bug where text inheriting a hyperlink (from a parent `<a>` tag) was not inheriting the parent's text styling (e.g., font, size, color).
- **Microsoft PowerPoint Compatibility**: Resolved a critical issue where dangling `[Content_Types].xml` overrides and `STORED` zip formats caused PowerPoint to reject files. All exports are now normalized and re-zipped with `DEFLATE`.
- **Vertical Text Optimization**: Resolved character spacing gaps in vertical writing modes (`writing-mode: vertical-rl/lr`) and corrected alignment axis mapping for vertical text blocks.
- **Text Wrap & Width Buffer**: Implemented sub-pixel rect sizing for unrotated elements, preserve offset sizing for rotated elements, floor font sizes to 0.1pt, and add a 1.5% text width buffer to prevent cross-platform wrapping differences.
- **Redundant Spacing Fix**: Fixed a bug where root element margins were double-applied as internal paragraph spacing. standalone text boxes now align perfectly with their DOM counterparts.
- **Options**: A new `options.skipNormalize` (default `false`) escape hatch is available for debugging the raw PptxGenJS output.
- **Full Opacity Inheritance**: Implemented accumulated opacity tracking during DOM traversal, ensuring nested elements and text runs correctly reflect the transparency of parent containers.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- **AI Skills Installer (CLI)**: Added `npx dom-to-pptx-skills` interactive installer to automatically distribute professional PPT creation skills to Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and Cursor.
- **Smart Agent Auto-Detection**: CLI now scans the home directory to detect installed AI agents and suggests appropriate installation paths.
- **Premium Design Themes**: Integrated 6 new high-fidelity visual presets (Neo-Brutalism, Soft Pastel, Swiss Minimalism, Nature Eco, Luxury Noir, Cyberpunk Neon) into the skill library.
- **Structured Prompt Architecture**: Re-architected `SKILL.md` with a "Principal Visual Engineering Director" persona and XML-like `<SLIDE_CONFIG>` templates to improve performance on low-end AI models.
- **Vertical-Align CSS Support**: Implemented support for the `vertical-align` property. Text can now be explicitly aligned to the `middle` or `bottom` of its container, matching browser rendering.

### Fixed

- **XML Namespace Corruption**: Resolved a critical issue where font embedding generated invalid OpenXML tags in the null namespace. Switched to explicit `createElementNS` and `setAttributeNS` with standard OOXML namespaces to ensure PPTX file integrity.
- **Vertical Alignment Regression**: Fixed an issue where text in tall block elements (like `<p>` or `<div>` with fixed heights) was incorrectly middle-aligned by default. Standard block elements now correctly default to top-alignment unless flex centering or explicit `vertical-align` is used.
- **Centered Padding Logic**: Removed aggressive logic that zeroed out padding when text was centered; padding (insets) is now correctly preserved and combined with alignment.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Native URL Background-Image**: Extended CSS extraction to organically parse `background-image: url('...')` blocks, leveraging CSS properties like `background-size` directly into the PPTX image crops.

### Fixed

- **Fractional Font Precision**: Abandoned destructive rounding when resolving HTML pixel layouts into PPTX typographical points (`pt`), enabling accurate 1/10th decimal scaling for accurate small font conversions.
- **AutoFit CJK Word Wraps**: Swapped out hard bounding boxes on textual spans to inject `<a:spAutoFit/>`, letting PowerPoint actively grow the block bounds when fluid lines or CJK formats forcefully wrap beyond the original Chrome layout metric.
- **Table Nested Text Line Breaks**: Remapped logic blocking structural line wrapping (e.g. `<br>`, `<div>`) within nested `<td/th>` wrappers preventing paragraph-mushing over complex table schemas.
- **Vertical Flow Orientation**: Fixed CSS `writing-mode` matching. Dynamically routes explicit `vertical-lr` and `vertical-rl` coupled with CSS `text-orientation: upright` specifically into their exact PowerPoint vertical equivalents.
- **Corrupt PPTX Fix (rectRadius)**: Resolved a critical "corrupt presentation" error caused by passing raw ratios for `rectRadius` to PptxGenJS. The library now calculates and passes absolute inch values capped at 50% for maximum stability.

### Changed

- **Documentation Standards**: Extensively published guidelines establishing CSS `grid`/`flex` layout priority over restrictive legacy `table` parameters in SUPPORTED.md.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Portrait & Custom Layouts**: Implemented support for portrait view and custom slide dimensions via `width`, `height`, and `layout` options in `exportToPptx`.
- **Advanced Table Typography**: Added support for `text-transform` (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize) and `letter-spacing` (charSpacing) in table cells and nested text.
- **Table Cell Gradient Fallback**: Table cells with background gradients now automatically extract and use a fallback color.

### Fixed

- **Table Rendering Precision**: Resolved rendering issues by aligning cell border formats with the PptxGenJS positional array API `[top, right, bottom, left]`.
- **Border Naming**: Fixed border property naming from `style` to `type` as required by PptxGenJS v3.
- **Table Layout**: Improved `colWidths` calculation to correctly handle `colspan` during layout extraction.
- **Rich Text in Cells**: Refactored cell text extraction to recurse into child nodes, preserving nested formatting (bold, color, etc.) as native rich text runs.

### Changed

- **Refactored Text Extraction**: Moved `collectListParts` to `utils.js` as `collectTextParts` to be shared between list and table processing.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **SVG Vector Export**: New `svgAsVector` option keeps SVG elements as vectors instead of rasterizing them to PNG. This enables "Convert to Shape" in PowerPoint for fully editable charts and graphics.

### Fixed

- **Recursion Logic** Resolved recursion issues where containers with partial border-radius (like `.glass-box`) were incorrectly rasterized as images, making children uneditable.
- **Fontawesome Icon partially rendering:** Solved icon clipping issues by injecting a global style tag to enforce FontAwesome font family and correct image display properties during potential rasterization.

### Changed

- **Code Refactoring**: Extracted `inlineSvgStyles` for better style consistency between raster and vector exports.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- **Tailwind CSS v4 Support**: Added robust color parsing for modern CSS color formats (e.g., `oklch`, `lab`, `display-p3`) used by Tailwind v4. The library now uses canvas-based normalization to support any valid CSS color.
- **Text Gradient Fallback**: Text with CSS gradients (e.g., `background-clip: text`) now gracefully falls back to the _first color_ of the gradient string instead of rendering as invisible or black.
- **List Marker Customization**: Support for `::marker` pseudo-element styles. Custom bullet colors and font sizes are now preserved in the generated PowerPoint.

### Fixed

- **AutoFit CJK Word Wraps**: Swapped out hard bounding boxes on textual spans to inject `<a:spAutoFit/>`, letting PowerPoint actively grow the block bounds when fluid lines or CJK formats forcefully wrap beyond the original Chrome layout metric.
- **Text Alignment**: Fixed an issue where text containers were slightly shorter than browser rendering, causing overlap with subsequent elements. Added a precision buffer to account for font metric differences.
- **Line Breaks**: Fixed an issue where `<br>` tags with surrounding whitespace caused double line breaks in the output.
- **Missing Elements (Cone Fix)**: Fixed a bug where empty elements with solid backgrounds and partial border radii (e.g., decorative shapes) were skipped during rasterization. We now generate a high-fidelity Vector SVG for these shapes.
- **Inline Badges**: Improved flow for inline elements with backgrounds (badges), ensuring they align correctly with surrounding text.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- **Table Supprt**: Added support for table elements like `<table>`, `<th>` `<td>`, `<tr>` with basic css formatting.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- **Canvas Support**: Added support for `<canvas>` elements. Libraries like **ECharts** and **Chart.js** now render correctly as images instead of blank spaces.
- **Backend Upload Support**: Added `skipDownload` option to `exportToPptx`. The function now returns a `Promise<Blob>`, allowing developers to upload the generated file to a server instead of triggering a browser download.
- **List Configuration**: Added `listConfig` option to manually override bullet colors and spacing (before/after) globally.
- **Icon Support in Lists**: Added logic to capture pseudo-element content (`::before`), ensuring icons (e.g., FontAwesome) inside list items are rendered correctly.

### Fixed

- **Native Lists**: HTML `<ul>` and `<ol>` lists are now rendered as a single native PowerPoint text box with real bullets, rather than disconnected text shapes.
- **Line Height Calculation**: Fixed an issue where pixel-based CSS `line-height` was interpreted as a multiplier in PowerPoint, causing text to overlap or crush.
- **Paragraph Spacing**: CSS `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` are now correctly converted to PowerPoint points (`paraSpaceBefore` / `paraSpaceAfter`).
- **List Item Spacing**: Fixed a bug where list items had double line breaks, causing excessive spacing between bullets.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue where ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists were not rendered correctly in exported PPTX files. (Fixes #8)
- Corrected geometric shape rendering issues related to absolute positioning and percentage-based sizing to ensure accurate layout in PPTX exports. (Fixes #6)
- Fixed text box width calculation discrepancies that caused incorrect line breaks and text wrapping in PPTX output. (Fixes #5)

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- **Automatic Font Discovery:** The library now automatically scans the DOM for used font families, extracts their `@font-face` URLs from the document stylesheets, and embeds them into the PPTX file; Addresses Feature Request [#4].
- **Custom Font Embedding:** Added support for manually embedding web fonts (TTF, WOFF, OTF).
- **Font Configuration:** Added `fonts` option for manual font URLs and `autoEmbedFonts` (default: `true`) to toggle automatic detection.

### Changed

- **Build Configuration:** Updated Rollup build to include necessary Node.js polyfills (Buffer, Stream) for the browser bundle to support binary font manipulation.
- **Text Detection:** Improved `isTextContainer` logic to better distinguish between pure text nodes and structural inline elements (like icons or styled spans).

## [1.0.9] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed

- **Complex Gradients:** Fixed `linear-gradient` parsing to correctly support degree-based angles (e.g., `45deg`) and complex directional keywords (e.g., `to top right`), ensuring background gradients match the CSS exactly.
- **Icon Visibility:** Fixed an issue where icons (Font Awesome, Material Icons, etc.) nested within list items or text containers were being treated as empty text and failing to render, fixes [#3].

## [1.0.8] - 2025-12-12 (Hot-Patch)

### Fixed

- **Fixed SVGs not getting converted**: Seperated the logic to handle SVGs and Web Components/Icons.

## [1.0.7] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed

- **Fix Stacking Context/Z-Index**: Implemented logic to traverse and inherit Z-index from parents. Render queue is now sorted by Z-index then DOM order, preventing text from being hidden behind background cards.
- **Support Web Components/Icons**: Updated `createRenderItem` and `isTextContainer` to recognize `ion-icon` and custom tags. These are now rasterized via canvas rather than ignored.
- **Fix Mixed Content (Icons + Text)**: Switched main traversal loop to use `childNodes` instead of `children`. Added specific handler for `nodeType === 3` (Text Nodes) to render orphan text residing next to icons/shapes.
- **Fix Styled Inline Spans (Badges)**: Updated `isTextContainer` to return `false` if children have visible backgrounds or borders. This ensures elements like "Pune/Vashi" badges render as individual styled shapes instead of flattening into unstyled text runs.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- Standalone UMD bundle `dist/dom-to-pptx.bundle.js` which includes runtime dependencies for single-script usage.
- `SUPPORTED.md` listing common supported HTML elements and CSS features.

### Fixed

- Rounded corner math: decreased false-positive circle detection and capped `rectRadius` to avoid pill-shaped elements becoming full circles.
- Partial border-radius clipping: elements inside `overflow:hidden` are now correctly rendered with clipping preserved.
- Very small elements (sub-pixel) rendering: lowered threshold to include tiny decorative elements (e.g., 2x2 dots).
- Backdrop blur support: simulated `backdrop-filter: blur()` using html2canvas snapshotting.
- CORS canvas errors: replaced fragile foreignObject rendering with safer SVG + canvas or html2canvas-based capture where appropriate.

## [1.0.3] - Previous

- Minor fixes and optimizations.
